    "#  This exercise is Part 4 of 4 of the Tic Tac Toe exercise series.\n",

    "    # Handle a player move from user input\n",

Your challenge in this exercise is to use the functions from those previous exercises all together in the same program to make a two-player game that you can play with a friend. There are a lot of choices you will have to make when completing this exercise, so you can go as far or as little as you want with it.\n",
